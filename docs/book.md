## Quotes

> This is an exceptional book. Usually, if a book contains either high-quality explanations or is written succinctly, I consider myself lucky to have found it. This one combines these two characteristics, which is super rare. It's another Go book for me and I still had quite a lot of "a-ha!" moments while reading it, and all of that without the unnecessary fluff, just straight to the point.

– Krystian (Goodreads user)

> This should be the required reading for all Golang developers before they touch code in Production... It's the Golang equivalent of the legendary 'Effective Java' by Joshua Bloch.

– _Neeraj Shah_

> Not having this will be the 101st mistake a Go programmer could make.

– _Anupam Sengupta_
